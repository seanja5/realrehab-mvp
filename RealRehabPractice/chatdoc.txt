RealRehab App Project Summary

Overview

RealRehab is a physical therapy (PT) app designed to connect patients and physical therapists through a structured rehabilitation experience using wearable sensor technology. The system combines Arduino-based motion tracking (IMU + flex sensor) with a SwiftUI mobile app connected to Supabase for backend storage, authentication, and data logging.

⸻

Current App Structure
	•	Frontend: SwiftUI (iOS)
	•	Backend: Supabase (connected to GitHub repository)
	•	Hardware: Arduino with BLE, IMU sensor, and flex sensor integrated into a knee brace

⸻

Key Screens Implemented
	1.	SelectLoginView.swift
	•	Patient and PT login options.
	•	Patient login now routes to PTDetailView.swift.
	2.	AllSetView.swift
	•	“Get Started!” button routes users to PTDetailView.swift.
	3.	PTDetailView.swift
	•	Displays the PT’s info card (name, phone, email).
	•	Shows current rehab plan with placeholder image and title.
	•	Includes a secondary button (“Edit Schedule”) below the rehab title, linking to RehabOverviewView.swift.
	•	Tapping the image routes users to JourneyMapView.swift.
	4.	PatientDetailView.swift
	•	Displays patient name, DOB, gender, recent appointments, rehab plan, and editable notes.
	•	Tapping outside text fields saves data automatically.
	•	“Select Rehab Plan” button routes to CategorySelectView.swift.
	5.	PTJourneyMapView.swift
	•	Mirrors JourneyMapView.swift layout with improved icon consistency.
	•	Includes draggable lesson bubbles with pop-up parameter settings (reps, rest, lock toggle).
	•	Pop-up closes when tapping outside, saving input.
	6.	CalibrateDeviceView.swift
	•	Guides users through device calibration: setting starting and maximum positions.
	•	Added instructional body text for clarity.
	7.	JourneyMapView.swift
	•	Displays visual progression of lessons in a zig-zag map format.

⸻

Recent Functionality Updates
	•	Implemented pop-up editor for bubble lessons.
	•	Improved drag-and-drop logic and disabled screen scrolling while dragging.
	•	Matched UI consistency between PT and patient views.
	•	Enabled text fields to dismiss on tap-out globally.
	•	Added new routing logic for login and rehab detail screens.
	•	Added instructional text on calibration screen for better user guidance.

Upcoming Tasks (Nov 6 – Dec 1)
	1.	Supabase Integration (Nov 6–8)
	•	Implement full backend functionality.
	•	Set up authentication (patient + PT login).
	•	Create and test database schema (users, rehab plans, session data, sensor metrics).
	2.	Sensor Calibration & Testing (Nov 9–13)
	•	Integrate flex sensor + IMU + Arduino.
	•	Validate data output and ensure correct range mapping.
	3.	BLE Connectivity (Nov 14–17)
	•	Connect Arduino BLE module to the app.
	•	Send calibration and exercise data to Supabase.
	4.	Hardware Assembly (Nov 18–24)
	•	Mount sensors securely onto the physical brace.
	•	Test comfort, durability, and signal reliability.
	5.	App + Hardware Testing (Nov 25–28)
	•	Test full calibration → exercise → feedback flow.
	•	Conduct multiple user trials to validate movement tracking accuracy.
	6.	Final Revisions (Nov 29–Dec 1)
	•	Fix UI/UX inconsistencies.
	•	Optimize Supabase data sync logic.
	•	Prepare MVP demo build.

⸻

Next Semester Goals (Starting Jan 12)
	•	Add new exercises: lunges, wall sits, step-ups.
	•	Improve kinematic calculations and motion accuracy.
	•	Research AI integration for motion feedback and pattern recognition.
